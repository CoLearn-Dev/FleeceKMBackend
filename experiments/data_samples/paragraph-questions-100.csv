2. Thomas Pynchon: Pynchon's novels, such as ""Gravity's Rainbow"" and ""V."", often feature labyrinthine plots, paranoid atmospheres, and a sense of disconnection, all reminiscent of Kafka's style.
3. Don DeLillo: DeLillo's novels, like ""White Noise"" and ""Underworld"", explore the intersection of technology, politics, and individual identity, echoing Kafka's concerns with modernity and alienation.
4. Harlan Ellison: Ellison's short stories, such as ""I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream"", often feature isolated protagonists trapped in nightmarish scenarios, reflecting Kafka's sense of existential despair.
5. J.G. Ballard: Ballard's dystopian novels, like ""Crash"" and ""High-Rise"", share Kafka's fascination with the darker aspects of human nature and the effects of modern society on the individual.

These authors, among others, have drawn inspiration from Kafka's unique blend of psychological insight, philosophical inquiry, and surreal narrative techniques to create their own distinctive visions of the sci-fi universe.",599370,6,2024-05-09 17:59:59,<sqlalchemy.orm.state.InstanceState object at 0x7f18d6bf0940>,1216295,1216471,2024-05-09 18:00:11,"The answer provides a list of science fiction authors whose works were influenced by Kafka's themes and precepts, which aligns with the question.

"In an article about 'Don 't Bother', section 'Background and composition'",""" Don 't Bother "" was written by Shakira and American pop music production trio The Matrix , which is composed of Lauren Christy , Graham Edwards , and Scott Spock . Shakira also produced the song . Similar to her seventh studio album Oral Fixation , Vol . 2 , ( 2005 ) , "" Don 't Bother "" musically shifts to a more rock styled composition as compared to Shakira 's previous releases . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony / ATV Music Publishing , the song is published in the key of E minor ( Relative key G major is in the chorus ) and has a moderate rock tempo of 130 beats per minute . Shakira 's vocal range on the song spans from the key of E3 to E5 . Through the lyrics of the song , Shakira urges her former lover not to "" bother "" feeling sorry for her after he chose another woman over her . She promises him that he "" won ' t ever see me [ Shakira ] cry "" and that she will move on in her life without him . The song contains a spoken bridge in which Shakira lists a number of things she could do to make him stay with her , such as "" move ( ing ) to a communist country "" , but admits that they would not have an effect on him . Pam Avoledo from Blogcritics found the theme of the song similar to the one in Shakira 's 2002 single "" Objection ( Tango ) "" . Shakira described the song as a feminist anthem , saying :","Who wrote ""Don't Bother"" along with Shakira?",Matrix.,2.0,"The answer ""Matrix"" is partially correct because it mentions the entity that co-wrote ""Don't Bother"" with Shakira.

"In an article about 'Kurt Angle', section 'Professional wrestling career', subsection 'Total Nonstop Action Wrestling', paragraph 'Championship reigns ( 2006 â€“ 2008 )'","At Final Resolution , Angle was booked to defeat Samoa Joe in a thirty-minute Iron Man match 3 - 2 to earn a shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Against All Odds , which he lost to Christian Cage after interference from Tomko and Scott Steiner . This led to a feud between Angle and Steiner , with Angle pinning Steiner at Destination X. After Angle defeated Steiner , he was picked to lead a team of four other wrestlers against a team of Christian Cage 's choice in a Lethal Lockdown match at April 's Lockdown . Angle chose Samoa Joe , Rhino , Sting , and Jeff Jarrett for Team Angle , while Cage chose A.J. Styles , Scott Steiner , Tomko , and Abyss . The man who gained the winning pinfall would become the number one contender to Christian Cage 's NWA World Heavyweight Championship . Team Angle was victorious after Jeff Jarrett hit Abyss with a gimmicked guitar full of thumbtacks and allowed Sting to score the pin . Cage was set to defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Sting and Angle in a triple threat match at Sacrifice . The day of the PPV , the National Wrestling Alliance ( NWA ) , the owners of the NWA World Heavyweight and the NWA World Tag Team Championships , stripped Cage of the title and Team 3D of the tag team title . NWA Executive Director Robert K. Trobich stated the reason was that Cage refused to defend the NWA Title at NWA live events . At the PPV event , Cage , still holding the physical NWA Championship belt , defended what was billed as the "" World Heavyweight Championship "" against Angle and Sting . Angle was the victor of said contest by making Sting submit , who had technically just pinned Cage , and was announced as the new "" World Heavyweight Champion "" . The Impact ! following the event , Angle came to the ring with a new championship belt , and announced he was the new "" TNA World Heavyweight Champion "" . Afterward , Cage and Sting came to the ring and the three began to argue over who was the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion . Due to the controversial finish to their match at Sacrifice , the title was declared vacant by Cornette . A tournament was held for the title which culminated in a King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary on June 17 , 2007 . At the event , Angle became the TNA World Heavyweight Champion by defeating Cage , Samoa Joe , A.J. Styles , and Chris Harris . He then attacked Joe after denying a request for a handshake , reigniting their feud . This also turned Angle heel in the process .",Who did Kurt Angle defeat in a thirty-minute Iron Man match at Final Resolution to earn a shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship?,Samoa,2.0,"The answer provided, ""Samoa"", is partially correct but lacks completeness. According to the text, Kurt Angle defeated Samoa Joe, not just ""Samoa"", in a thirty-minute Iron Man match at Final Resolution to earn a shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.

"In an article about 'Landscape painting in Scotland', section 'Nineteenth century'","In the Victorian era , the tradition of Highland landscape painting was continued by figures such as Horatio McCulloch ( 1806 - 67 ) , Joseph Farquharson ( 1846 - 1935 ) and William McTaggart ( 1835 - 1910 ) . McCulloch was a student of Knox . His images of places including Glen Coe , Loch Lomond and the Trossachs , became parlour room panoramas that defined popular images of Scotland . This was helped by the Queen 's declared affection for Scotland , signified by her adoption of Balmoral as a royal retreat . The wildlife around Balmoral was immortalised by English painter Edwin Landseer ( 1802 - 73 ) in the much copied Monarch of the Glen ( 1851 ) . In this period a Scottish "" grand tour "" developed with large number of English artists , including Turner , flocking to the Highlands to paint and draw . From the 1870s Farquharson was a major figure in interpreting Scottish landscapes , specialising in snowscapes and sheep , and using a mobile heated studio in order to capture the conditions from life . In the same period McTaggart emerged as the leading Scottish landscape painter . He has been compared with John Constable and described as the "" Scottish Impressionist "" , with free brushwork often depicting stormy seas and moving clouds . The fashion for coastal painting in the later nineteenth century led to the establishment of artist colonies in places such as Pittenweem and Crail in Fife , Cockburnspath in the Borders , Cambuskenneth near Stirling on the River Forth and Kirkudbright in Dumfries and Galloway . The Glasgow Boys emerged in the 1880s , rejecting much of the sentimentality of Scottish landscape painting and introducing elements of impressionism . Key figures included W. Y. Macgregor ( 1855 - 1923 ) , James Guthrie ( 1859 - 1930 ) , John Lavery ( 1856 - 1941 ) , George Henry ( 1858 - 1943 ) and E. A.

"In an article about 'Atomic Energy Act of 1946', section 'Amendment', subsection 'Private production of nuclear energy'","The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 proved insufficient in its objective of encouraging privately built and run nuclear reactors .

"In an article about 'Landscape painting in Scotland', section 'Nineteenth century'","In the Victorian era , the tradition of Highland landscape painting was continued by figures such as Horatio McCulloch ( 1806 - 67 ) , Joseph Farquharson ( 1846 - 1935 ) and William McTaggart ( 1835 - 1910 ) . McCulloch was a student of Knox . His images of places including Glen Coe , Loch Lomond and the Trossachs , became parlour room panoramas that defined popular images of Scotland . This was helped by the Queen 's declared affection for Scotland , signified by her adoption of Balmoral as a royal retreat . The wildlife around Balmoral was immortalised by English painter Edwin Landseer ( 1802 - 73 ) in the much copied Monarch of the Glen ( 1851 ) . In this period a Scottish "" grand tour "" developed with large number of English artists , including Turner , flocking to the Highlands to paint and draw . From the 1870s Farquharson was a major figure in interpreting Scottish landscapes , specialising in snowscapes and sheep , and using a mobile heated studio in order to capture the conditions from life . In the same period McTaggart emerged as the leading Scottish landscape painter . He has been compared with John Constable and described as the "" Scottish Impressionist "" , with free brushwork often depicting stormy seas and moving clouds . The fashion for coastal painting in the later nineteenth century led to the establishment of artist colonies in places such as Pittenweem and Crail in Fife , Cockburnspath in the Borders , Cambuskenneth near Stirling on the River Forth and Kirkudbright in Dumfries and Galloway . The Glasgow Boys emerged in the 1880s , rejecting much of the sentimentality of Scottish landscape painting and introducing elements of impressionism . Key figures included W. Y. Macgregor ( 1855 - 1923 ) , James Guthrie ( 1859 - 1930 ) , John Lavery ( 1856 - 1941 ) , George Henry ( 1858 - 1943 ) and E. A.

"In an article about 'William Howard Taft', section 'Overview'","With Roosevelt 's help , Taft had little opposition for the Republican nomination for president in 1908 , and easily defeated William Jennings Bryan for the presidency that November . In the White House , he focused on the Far East more than European affairs , and repeatedly intervened to prop up or remove Latin American governments . Taft sought reductions to the tariff , then a major source of governmental income , but the resulting bill was heavily influenced by special interests . His administration was filled with conflict between the conservative wing of the Republican Party , with which Taft often sympathized , and the progressive wing , toward which Roosevelt moved more and more . Controversies over conservation and over antitrust cases filed by the Taft administration served to further separate the two men . Roosevelt challenged Taft for renomination in 1912 . Taft used his control of the party machinery to gain a bare majority of delegates , and Roosevelt bolted the party . The split left Taft with little chance of re-election , and in Wilson 's victory won only Utah and Vermont .","What was the result of William Howard Taft's attempt to reduce tariffs, a major source of governmental income, during his administration?",Failed.,2.0,"The answer ""Failed"" is partially correct, as it implies that Taft's attempt to reduce tariffs did not achieve its intended goal.

Ferdinand de Rothschild promised to lend money in return for guarantees that the rebuilt line would include a passenger station at Westcott , and that the Duke would press the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway to open a station at the nearest point to Waddesdon Manor .

3. Don DeLillo: DeLillo's novels, like ""White Noise"" and ""Underworld"", explore the intersection of technology, politics, and individual identity, echoing Kafka's concerns with modernity and alienation.
4. Harlan Ellison: Ellison's short stories, such as ""I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream"", often feature isolated protagonists trapped in nightmarish scenarios, reflecting Kafka's sense of existential despair.
5. J.G. Ballard: Ballard's dystopian novels, like ""Crash"" and ""High-Rise"", share Kafka's fascination with the darker aspects of human nature and the effects of modern society on the individual.

Norway advocated for a median line approach, dividing the sea equally between the two countries based on the distance from their respective coastlines. Russia, on the other hand, claimed a sectoral approach, extending its EEZ northwards along the meridian from the easternmost point of the Kola Peninsula, resulting in a larger share of the disputed area.
